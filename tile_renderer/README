== Tile format

Tiles are built using the GeoJSON specification.

They're built in two phases, though, because it takes a long time to generate GeoJSON data, even after optimization.

=== Phase 1: GeoJSON data, UTFGrid

See GeoJSON 1.0: http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html
See UTFGrid 1.2 spec (as of 2012-01-11): https://github.com/mapbox/utfgrid-spec/blob/master/1.2/utfgrid.md

A tile looks like this:

{
  "type": "FeatureCollection", /* GeoJSON */
  "features": [ /* GeoJSON */
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": ...GeoJSON geometry...
      "id": "DisseminationArea-12314",
      "properties": {
        "uid": "12314",
        "type": "DisseminationArea",
        "name": "Statistics Canada-supplied name",
        "statistics": {
          "2011": {
            "Population": {
              "value": 4123,
              "note": "This number is totally correct"
            }
          },
          ...more statistics...
        }
      }
    },
    ...more features...
  ],
  "utfgrids": [ /* Not banned by the GeoJSON spec */
    {
      "grid": ["...", "...", ... ], /* UTFGrid */
      "keys": [ "", "Province-11", "ElectoralDistrict-132", ... ] /* UTFGrid */
    }
  ]
}

The GeoJSON contains all data necessary. UTFGrid data is entirely redundant.

We generate UTFGrid data by actually rendering the tiles onto in-memory SVGs
during creation. The benefit: the browser can quickly look up a GeoJSON
feature based on a pixel location.

Why is it a *list* of UTFGrids? Because there's no other way to transmit
partial hierarchies. For instance, if a Tract and Subdivision are in the
same spot, they're shown Tract-on-top-of-Subdivision on the map. But the
Subdivision isn't a parent of the Tract. The only way for the client to
see both (aside from actual hit-detection on vector data) is to transmit
two distinct hierarchies.

We mass-render into the "utfgrids" and "tile_features" tables. Both are keyed
by (zoom_level, tile_row, tile_column), which are standard across mapping
platforms. The latter table is also keyed by region ID and contains all the
properties we need. You can imagine, then, for a given tile, how we populate
the "utfgrids" column (a single SQL cell) and the "features" list (each entry
corresponds to an SQL row).

We do not render "statistics" in this phase. We postpone that to the last
possible instant, because we need to pre-process everything we can. That way,
when new statistics come out we can publish them much more quickly.

==== Implementation

1. Import regions from StatsCan data into the database.
2. From those regions, extract polygons. (script/preprocess-polygons.sql)
3. Decide which polygons to render at which zoom levels. (script/preprocess-polygons.sql)
4. Render them into region_polygon_tiles. (tile_renderer/render_region_polygon_tiles.py)
5. From region_polygon_tiles, render UTFGrids. (script/preprocess-utfgrids.sql, tile_renderer/render_utfgrids.py)
6. From region_polygon_tiles, render feature_tiles. (script/process-features.sql -- no Python needed)

Generally, straight SQL is much faster than Python because it works on all
its source data in bulk, instead of a row at a time. We only use Python where
it makes more sense:

1. Slicing a polygon into tiles: there's no good way in SQL to slice the way we do.
2. Rendering UTFGrids: we render SVG to an image buffer; SQL doesn't do that.

=== Phase 2: Statistics

We render a table of region_id -> statistics, which looks like the "statistics"
section in the GeoJSON tile description above. It's straightforward to generate
this: just loop over indicator_region_values, group by region and year, and
encode as JSON.

This is in ./render_statistics.py

=== Phase 3: Merge

For a given tile:

1. Select the UTFGrid JSON (an Array) from "utfgrids".
2. Select the features from "feature_tiles".
3. With the region IDs from step 2, select statistics from "statistics".
4. Create the "features" JSON Array using the results from steps 2 and 3.
5. Create the entire JSON tile through string concatenation.

There's no need for decoding and encoding JSON. The whole thing could
conceivably be done using SQL. (Why *not* merge as SQL? Because we merge on
the fly. Otherwise we'd be stuck with an 8GB database on our development
machine that we need to move to our servers. That would be too slow.)

== Time and space

There is a massive amount of geographic data to process, which is why it's all
done in Phase 1. But how long will it take?

On a speedy computer (Intel four-core, 2.5Ghz CPU, 8GB RAM), it takes about a
week to build a web-server-ready database--if you do the proper optimizations.

Why so long?

In total, there are about 45 million tiles to render. That means spending 2ms
on every tile on one processor takes one day. With a four-core machine, that
speeds up to 6 hours.

We put many operations on the database server itself, and for the rest we use
a "work_queue" design pattern, with a database table storing a queue of tasks.
The disadvantage of work_queue is its overhead: for 45M tiles, it's about 1ms
per tile: 3 hours. The disadvantages of straight SQL are that it's
single-threaded, it can't be interrupted and PostgreSQL sometimes decides to
create enormous temporary tables.

Here's a rough breakdown:

1. Preparing to render polygons: about a day
2. Rendering region_polygon_tiles: about three days
3. Rendering utfgrids: less than a day (with optimizations)
4. Rendering tile_features: less than a day
5. Importing indicator_region_values: a few minutes
6. Rendering statistics: a few minutes

Tasks 2 and 3 can be split across computers. Either make them share a database
server, or do the manual work of partitioning the work_queue and work_queue2
tables, running render_region_polygon_tiles.py and render_utfgrids.py on the
separate computers, and then merging the resulting region_polygon_tiles and
utfgrids tables afterwards. (And since utfgrids depends exactly on the data
produced from region_polygon_tiles, you don't need to merge the tables after
step 2 and split them before step 3.)

=== Optimizations

==== PostgreSQL

Our use case with PostgreSQL is: a few clients (either a single SQL command, or
a small army of paralellel processes doing the same few queries--ideally one
per CPU core. Few connections, massive computations. Turn work_mem up
(e.g. 32MB) and turn maintenance_work_mem way up (e.g. 1GB). Turn off
synchronous_commit: we can restart our processing at any command, and it's very
slow for lots of commits (which our work_queue method uses). Bump
checkpoint_segments up (e.g., to 64) because we do some enormous UPDATEs.

The work_queue overhead, in steps 2 and 3 above, comes out to roughly 10-15%,
which is acceptable.

==== Python

Run `python setup.py build` in the `tile_renderer/ext` directory for some
huge speed-ups to UTFGrid rendering (from 20ms to 3ms on a speedy computer).
We use C code to avoid Python objects and to optimize a loop that turns an
ARGB image buffer into Unicode strings.

Incidentally: Python threading isn't ideal for us, because of its Global
Interpreter Lock. We use processes instead.
